# PDFMerger

The main goal of the project was to develop a WPF app that merges PDF files. 
The user can add files to the list, remove them, and move them up or down on the list.
The user needs to provide a destination path for the merged PDF file. After it, there is an option to merge all files from the list.
In the project, the MVVM pattern was implemented.
